Grimcraft
=========

The first mod from The Think Plank. Grimcraft adds new functionality to the Nether, keeping faithful to the vanilla style.

Planned features include:
- New ores, blocks, and materials with which to craft.
- Four new crops and even more delicious foodstuffs.
- Friendly and not-so-friendly mobs to tame and fight.
- New potions to please your inner alchemist.
- Improved vanilla mechanics for a more fulfilling, difficult, and exciting Nether experience.
